# Chore Cats

Chore Cats is a gamified to-do list app for chores! Complete chores and collect more cats to cozy up with in your room.

This app was originally created as part of a uni assignment. Check out the [tech-demo](https://github.com/boxy8/chore-cats/tree/tech-demo) branch for some extra code here and there to demonstrate the benefits of TypeScript vs JavaScript, as well as the assignment video transcript.
